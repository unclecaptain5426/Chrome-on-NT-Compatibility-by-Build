Chrome 30.0.1599.1xx - last unofficial version for vanilla Windows 2000
Chrome 31-32 is startable on Windows 2000 unofficially, but it does not load pages properly, and --no-sandbox used triggers an 0x80000003 breakpoint.
Chrome 32.0.1700.107 - for Windows Whistler Late Beta 1 Build 2419
Chrome 12.0.730 Dev+ with modifications is startable on Windows XP Pre-Beta 2 Build 2410/2416 - Windows XP Pre-RC 1 Build 2475, but it does not load webpages (and even enabling --no-sandbox will result in 0xc0000094 division by zero error and webpages will crash with "Aw Snap!" instead), and Task Manager will just instantly Crash Chrome. So Chrome 12.0.730+ only works since Windows XP Pre-RC 1 Build 2481
Chrome 49.0.2623.112 - is the last version to work on Windows XP SP1 Beta Build 2600.1050 and Windows .NET Server Build 3604
